//switch case is a control structure in C programming used to select and execute one of many code blocks based on the value of a variable or expression. It provides a cleaner and more efficient alternative to multiple if-else statements when you need to check a single variable against several possible values
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x;
    printf("Enter a number: \n");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    switch (x)
    {
    case 1:
        
        break;
    
    default:
        break;
    }
